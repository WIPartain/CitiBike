# CitiBike

## Overview
We were given the opportunity to utilize Tableau to more effectively visualize CitiBike data.  We made an adjustment to the format of the trip duration data, and we used it to effectively determine the amount of time customers used the bikes.  From there, we created a series of visualizations:

## Results
1. In the first visualization, we determine trip duration for total bike population.  It appears as though the majority of purchases only last for a few minutes.  Very rarely do the trip durations last for over an hour.

2. In the second visualization, we break down trip durations by gender.  We can see that the majority of riders are male, but each gender seems to follow the same trends regarding trip duration.  Very rarely do these trips last longer than an hour.

3. In the third visualization, we used a heatmap to determine the most popular times of day for each weekday for bicycle rentals.  On weekdays, bike rentals are typically strongest around 7-9 am and 5-7 pm. On the weekends, the volume of rentals is consistent from 11am-4pm.

4. In the fourth visualization, we used a heatmap to determine the most popular times of day for each day by gender.  These heatmaps follow the same trends established in visualization 3.  The male volume is much higher than the female volume, but the trends are consistent for both genders.

5. In the fifth visualization, we studied the volume of trips by gender by day and whether the purchase was by a unique customer or subscriber.  We determined the majority of bikers were subscribers and the highest volume for subscribers was on wednesdays.  Again, the trends were similar for men and women with men generating a higher volume of bikes.

6.  The sixth visualization was the starting points of the bikes across the city.  Th bikes are clustered pretty close together, but they are contained within the bodies of water to the north and the west

7.  The seventh vizualization was the ending points of the bikes across the city.  The bikes are in somewhat similar locations with a few displaced across the bodies of water to the west and the north.

## Summary
Tableau is an excellent option for visualization, and we were able to make a few determinations based on our data and the visualizations we produced.  The majority of our customers are subscribers as opposed to one time customers.  Our subscribers are mostly male, however our female customers follow similar patterns to the male customers in terms of trip duration and time of day.  I would like to also determine subscriber vs customer density in certain geographic locations to increase bike density in high traffic areas.  After determining this information, I would also like to dig into age of our subscribers to see if we can more effectively market our services.
